	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Halo 3 is a first-person shooter video game. It tells the fictional events and settings in the Halo universe at the end of the Halo trilogy. It was developed by Bungie Studios and published by Microsoft. Halo 3 was released on September 25, 2007 in Australia, Brazil, India, New Zealand, North America, and Singapore; September 26, 2007 in the UK and Europe; and September 27, 2007 in Japan all exclusively for the Xbox 360. The game is rated "M" for Mature for blood, gore, violence, and mild language by the ESRB. Europe's PEGI rating system gave the game a "16+" rating, which serves as a guideline rather than as a rule. It is rated "15" by the BBFC for UK release and rated "M" by the OFLC for it's Australia and New Zealand release. Upon its release, Halo 3 grossed US$300 million in its first week. More than one million people played Halo 3 on Xbox Live in the first twenty hours. By January 3, 2008, Halo 3 sold 8.1 million copies, and was the best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S.. Overall, the game was very well received by critics, with the Forge and multiplayer offerings singled out as strong features. According to Bungie as of March 2012, Halo 3 collectively with Halo 3: ODST, more than 11.5 billion games have been played. </p>
	<h2>Why it is my Favorite</h2>
	<p> Halo 3 was my first introduction into first-person shooter games as I used to play it on my brother's Xbox 360. I fell in love immediately despite my parent's insistence on me waiting till I was older to play and the main thing I remembered from those days was playing online against random people and them talking trash to a 10 year old which I thought was pretty funny in hindsight. The game is truly well made and stands the test of time as it's graphics can still be compared to recent releases while the mechanics of the game were far ahead in time. </p>
